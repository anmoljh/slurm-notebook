Important Points:-

1. Be careful while specifying SLURM parameters both in the BATCH Script via #SBATCH and on the line of srun in the Script. 

2. Is there any defaults, priority, allocation and override rules?   

   Override Rule:- Environment variables will override any options set in a batch script, 
   and command line options will override any environment variables. 

3. Useful env variables in slurm.

   Output Environment Variables:-
     $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
     $SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE
     $SLURM_NTASKS
     $SLURM_TASK_PID
     $SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE
     $SLURM_JOB_NODELIST
     $SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES
     $SLURM_JOB_PARTITION
     $SLURMD_NODENAME
